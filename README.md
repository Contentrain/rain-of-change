A free Changelog template created with [**Nuxt 3.0**](https://nuxtjs.org) & [**Nuxt Content 2.0**](https://content.nuxtjs.org) that you can use for your projects.

We are very pleased to share our first free template. We hope Rain of Change will help anyone who needs to keep a Changelog for their projects.

You can customize this template as you wish by copying it to your own repository and pulling it to your local.

## Headless CMS
[![Use with Contentrain](https://imagedelivery.net/yx26LyQGM_miwnGU8RnEaw/721c176e-f4b1-4495-1d6c-87a4b9ffa100/public)](https://app.contentrain.io)


To manage the content of this template, we recommend you use [**Contentrain**](Contentrain).

We have created the collection template that you need. You can find and use this collection in “Community Collections”.

After free registration with [Contentrain](**Contentrain**), you need to start a manual project installation and continue the installation by selecting the Rain of Change repo on Github.

During the installation, it is enough to delete the sample collections in the Collections step, select the Logs collection from the Community Collections section and complete the installation.

This way you can easily manage all your logs with Contentrain.

If you have any question with the installation, you can send us your questions via [Discord](**Discord**).

We will soon publish a video about how to use this template with Contentrain.
