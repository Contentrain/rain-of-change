Improvements
------------

*   Now speakers can join a stream with an easier flow. One click through the link shared with you is enough to join a stream you are invited. Also in the stream page, event link is much more discoverable now for people who wants to share the event with others.
*   When people ask a question in chat during a livestream, we onboard them how to turn their message into a question type so that it can be upvoted by the audience and answered by the host.

Fixes
-----

*   Fix display problems when adding speakers to a stream with twitter handle.
